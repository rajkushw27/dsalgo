# Node Depths

A Binary Tree is represented by a list of nodes and a root node. Every node has to have a unique string id that will be referenced by other nodes' left and right pointers and by the root.

The distance between a node in a Binary Tree and the tree's root is called the node's depth.
Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and returns the sum of its nodes' depths.
