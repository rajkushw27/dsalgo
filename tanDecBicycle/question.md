# tandem Bicycle

A tandem bicycle is a bicycle that's operated by two people: person A and
person B. Both people pedal the bicycle, but the person that pedals faster
dictates the speed of the bicycle. So if person A pedals at a speed of
5, and person B pedals at a speed of 4, the tandem
bicycle moves at a speed of 5 (i.e.
tandemSpeed = max(speedA, speedB))

You're given two lists of positive integers: one that contains the speeds of riders wearing red shirts and one that containsthe speeds of riders wearing blue shirts. Each rider is represented by a single positive integer, which is the speed thatthey pedal a tandem bicycle at. Both lists have the same length, meaning that there are as many red-shirt riders as there areblue-shirt riders. Your goal is to pair every rider wearing a red shirt with a rider wearing a blue shirt to operate a tandembicycle.
